**Overview of School District Analysis**
---
<sub>In this project, Maria asked us to deliver an analysis of multiple schools metrics to report to the school board. The provided data needed to be cleaned and then broken down into key metrics and organized for readability. After our analysis of the schools, the board found an anomaly. We were asked to removed the suspected false data and provide a new analysis in deliverable 1.</sub>

**Results**
---
1. When the testing data for the 9th grade was nulled, we found that the %Overall Passing only fell by less than 1%
2. However when we removed the 9th grade from our data frame, we found a big leap. The %Overall Passing fell by almost 25%.
3. Before adjusting Thomas Highschools data, they were in the top 5 school and fell to the 3rd to last after the adjustment.
4. As a result all the other schools averages and ranks were raised due to being compared to true data.

**Summary**
---
Originally our top five were Cabrera, Thomas, Griffin, Wilson, and Pena. After our final analysis this completely changes and is now Cabrera, Griffin, Wilson, Pena, and Wright. Our school size averages were affected heavily. The %Overall Passing of medium schools fell from 91% to 85%. And charter schools %Overall Passing fell from 90% to 87%. So this one schools misinformation affected our overall metrics by huge margins.
